# Rigol-Oscilloscope-DS2000

Version 2:
An attempt to make the code cleaner. I created scopeclass.py file that is the basis of communication between computer and oscilloscope, which I believe is the most interesting part of this repository. I also tried to standarize the outputs that are returned from functions. 

Version 1:
I am going to create program to obtain data from Rigol DS2000 oscilloscope connected to ion mobility spectrometer
that I used in laboratory.

The code is partially taken from following page:
